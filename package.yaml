description:
    The structure of the program consists of a few channels,
    in every channel one function related to channel executes.
    The life cycle of such function is absolutely simple.
    The function reads from channel and depending from content of channel and
    # input variables execute some actions.
    # In IT literature such entity named actor.

    # There are three actors: central actor, server actor and client actor.

    # The server actor responsible for receiving messages from unfamiliar nodes.

    # The client actor responsible for connecting to sever actor of yet
    # unfamiliar node.

    # The central actor responsible for storing node state and manage decision,
    # processing external commands and response for them.
